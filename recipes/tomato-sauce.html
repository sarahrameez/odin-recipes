    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is perhaps the most famous recipe created by Marcella Hazan, the cookbook author who changed how Americans
        cook Italian food. It also may be her easiest. Use your favorite canned tomatoes for this and donâ€™t be scared
        off by the butter. It gives the sauce an unparalleled velvety richness</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2 cups</strong> tomatoes</li>
        <li><strong>5 tablespoons</strong> butter</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> onion, cut and peeled in half</li>
        <li>salt <strong>to taste</strong> </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the tomatoes, their juices, the butter and the onion halves in a saucepan. Add a pinch or two of
            salt.</li>
        <li>Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about 45 minutes. Stir occasionally,
            mashing any large pieces of tomato with a spoon. Add salt as needed.</li>
        <li>Discard the onion before tossing the sauce with pasta. This recipe makes enough sauce for a pound of pasta.
