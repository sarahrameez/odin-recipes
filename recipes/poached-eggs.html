    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Poached eggs are a beautiful thing. The whites are just firm enough on the outside to contain an oozy, golden
        yolk in a round little egg package. And with a few tips, you too can learn how to poach an egg perfectly every
        time!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1</strong> large egg</li>
        <li><strong>1-2 tbsp</strong> vinegar, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.</li>
        <li>While waiting for the water to boil, crack an egg into a small fine mesh sieve over a bowl. Swirl the egg in
            the sieve until all the liquid-y egg whites have been removed. Then, place the egg in a ramekin.</li>
        <li>Stir the vinegar into the water and create a vortex. Add the egg to the middle of the vortex and cook the
            egg for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the egg with a slotted spoon and dab it on a paper towel to remove any excess water. Serve
            immediately.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, if making the poached eggs for meal prep or ahead of time, transfer the cooked poached eggs
            to an ice water bath and refrigerate for a couple of days. When ready to serve, add boiling water to a bowl,
            then add the cold poached egg and submerge for 20-30 seconds or until warmed through. Remove the poached egg
            with a slotted spoon, dab dry and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
